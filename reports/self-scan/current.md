# Ultron self-scan — actionable source findings

Finding signature: 937e5b42bc00478e44f47e7e4a10f8578d486af513f11f01b9f9cf4626c22d09
Observed GitHub main SHA: 03403f69e37e27bdbb3670d7baa922557e18ed1a
Observed source tree SHA: 7903b00544f6fb0310d336835fe1673173859999

Authority: exact GitHub main, not a deployed production runtime

## Findings

| Priority | Code | Evidence | Suggested next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| high | live-execution-unobserved | Source inspection cannot attest a production request or response | Run an authenticated end-to-end task and validate its durable result |
| medium | learning-effect-unobserved | The scan has no independently scored future-task or held-out cognition outcome | Compare actual realized outcomes against prior predictions before updating policy |

## Unverified capabilities (do not treat as healthy)

- Runtime: not-probed
- Provider: not-probed
- Production convergence: not-probed
- Independent learning gain: not-established

## Next steps

- Compare actual realized outcomes against prior predictions before updating policy
- Run an authenticated end-to-end task and validate its durable result

This PR is a source scan, not a verified code fix.
Proposed repairs require separate tested implementation before closure.
