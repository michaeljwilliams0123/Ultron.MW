# Ultron self-scan — actionable source findings

Finding signature: b7885086a40f393dbd2553571295419657d5a4e5a759db1241f5b5a9ed7806a4
Observed GitHub main SHA: e8c85c44a0bde2736498e059e05b196f694af99a
Observed source tree SHA: 33dbb49e8a0e579258efe711a351eb23bd3ac39c
Observed at: 2026-10-22T12:43:14.299Z
Authority: exact GitHub main, not a deployed production runtime

## Findings

| Priority | Code | Evidence | Suggested next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| high | live-execution-unobserved | Source inspection cannot attest a production request or response | Run an authenticated end-to-end task and validate its durable result |
| medium | learning-effect-unobserved | The scan has no independently scored future-task or held-out cognition outcome | Compare actual realized outcomes against prior predictions before updating policy |

## Unverified capabilities (do not treat as healthy)

- Runtime: not-probed
- Provider: not-probed
- Production convergence: not-probed
- Independent learning gain: not-established

## Next steps

- Compare actual realized outcomes against prior predictions before updating policy
- Run an authenticated end-to-end task and validate its durable result

This PR is a source scan, not a verified code fix.
Proposed repairs require separate tested implementation before closure.
